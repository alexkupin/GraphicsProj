Computer Graphics Project #2
Alex Kupin and Sarah Inzerillo

This HTML file generates an interactive Park scence, including a swingset, a park bench, a trash can, and a rotation merry-go round.

OBJECTS
Each object was created by Alex in AutoCad Maya. First We modeled the object to how we would like it to be shown, then We exported 
them as .obj files including the vertices, faces, and texture coordinates. We then created an extraction tool to obtain the correct
format needed in the .js files (i.e. extracted the points into a list or a list of vec4()'s) to be used as functions. We followed
these steps for the merry-go round, the swing set, trash can, and park bench.

INTERATION
The mery go round object can be rotated around it's y-axis, creating a realistic representation of motions in a Park. To make
this transformation occur, the user can pren the "A" key or the "D" Key.

VIEWING AND LIGHTING
The scene is viewed using perspective projection. There are currently two lights on the scene. There is a point light at position
X,Y,Z and a directional light with the direction of X,Y,Z. Specular relfection is aplied to the point light. The affect of these 
lights are multiplied with the texture colors in the fragment shader.

TEXTURE
We applied two Textures into the scene. We applied a wood texture to the park bench to make a wood bench and trash can, and also used a rough
seamless metal texture for the merry go round and swing set, as that is likely the more used material for these 
objects. Both of these texture were make using images edited so that they were power of 2 pixel images.
